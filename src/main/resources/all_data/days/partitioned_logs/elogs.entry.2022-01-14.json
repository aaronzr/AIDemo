CBL - RF/BCS support. S8, cable installation prep. S10, FACET II cable installation. S30, BTH, B911, cable tagging. S2P3, cable dressing. Cryo - Prep for cooldown. CTLS - Magnet checkout. Motion control system checkout. Tunnel radio signal checkout. S16, wirescanner pigtail connections. FACC - Install shielding in gallery penetrations. S0 AOR door, smoke seal installation. FACOE - S0 fire station energization review. FACOI - LCW system p/m support. FACOM - LCW system p/m. Metrology - S29,S30, component alignment. MFD - Linac Middle, Linac East vacuum activities. S28-S30, magnet water connections. Housing housekeeping. He guard line installation. BC-2, Removed PF Cart #1 from BC2 upstream BC2B/EMIT portion of beamline. Injector, installed PF Cart #1 on downstream Injector COL0 line for removal of VPIO:COL0:762 ion pump. Conductor pin in HV feedthrough is shorted to ground. Pump is non-functional. PF Cart #3 still connected to upstream HTR for OTR0H04 installation. Part still in need of rework. Injector/Gun, suitcase SN02 connection to airlock leak checked. NIL! Turned system back over to Injector Gun team. PEM - LCLS and FACET II support. S4, magnet connections. Diag kicker checkout. PPS - Prep for LCLS start-up. Test Lab - NIRP system labeling. Contractors - Collins - S28-S30, component base grouting. Vance Brown - S0 fire station project. Regards, Al",

I would estimate that we have it 60-70% complete, though many of the remaining checkboxes are fairly routine (we prioritized the non-standard checks). We encountered a large number of issues with the hardware and with the checklist itself. Some of these issues were already known but I'll include them here for the sake of thoroughness. Known issues: * LI09 equipment key release talks to the search keybank and vice-versa. * LI04 search keybank continues to read complete even when the key has been removed. Issues that we think are new: * S9 Manway camera behavior is not consistent. Earlier today it was extremely jerky (not up to our normal standards for monitoring PPS transactions). Moreover, we were able to launch it on OPI12 but not on OPI10 (VLC threw a bunch of errors). I just checked it again on OPI10 and it works perfectly now, not clear what changed in the last few hours. CATER 154589. * Sonalert behavior for manway door E/E mechanisms was very inconsistent from one sector to the next. CATER 154590. * Manway door magnalocks still indicated that they were on (both in the control system and locally at the door itself) when using the E/E mechanisms to crash in and out. CATER 154591. * Not PPS-related, but: we tested WiFi calling down in the linac and were not able to make it work (we had heard that people on the Verizon network were having this problem). * We could not get the LI02 AOR door to close properly. Zach tried closing it with more force, which caused the hydraulic closing mechanism to rupture. CATER 154588. * There is very little rhyme or reason to the EO mechanisms downstairs in terms of which EO string they trip in the control system. I think this is a known issue and there are no plans to fix it. However, more seriously, we observed that hitting the EOs in sector 6 caused the EOs way down at the end of sector 7 to flash (NOT the EOs in sector 6). The EOs in sector 7 did not cause any EO lights to flash that we could observe. CATER 154592. * S10 adit PPS gate tongue is stuck so the gate cannot be mechanically latched. CATER 154593. I will cover issues with the checklist itself through CDMS.",

    "title": "D McCormick looked at LI19 XCOR 402 for CATER 154059",
    "text": "This corrector was CATER'd because we saw it having the opposite effect of what we expect when steering. When increasing the strength of the corrector (positive BDES) we saw the x position on a downstream BPM become more negative. Doug compared the polarities of the 302 and 402 XCORs and found that they have the same polarity, but we have not seen the same behavior on 302. While looking at the corrector, he noted that the north pole was below the beamline and the south pole above it, i.e. the magnetic field points +y when the BDES is positive. Using the left hand rule (since we have negatively charged electrons), we would expect this to bend the electrons in the +x direction. This leads us to believe that the polarity of 402 is correct so no changes were made to it. This does not explain the behavior seen when we created the CATER. Looking at the FACET beamline maps, I don't see LI19 XCOR 402 anywhere so it is unclear if there are any other nearby components that could explain the discrepancy we were seeing.",

    "text": "This corrector is labeled as a LI15 corrector in the field. We verified that we were looking at the same corrector by adjusting its strength in the SCP (LI14 magnets -&gt; YCOR 900) while Doug measured the voltage in the field and saw it increasing. The B-field on this corrector was pointing from south to north (pointing left while looking downstream), which would deflect an electron beam in the -y direction with positive BDES setting, which is the opposite of what we expect, indicating that the polarity is reversed. Doug is going to flip it. This should resolve the issue in CATER 154055",
