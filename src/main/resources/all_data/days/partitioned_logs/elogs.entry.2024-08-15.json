I'll try to go point by point and respond:</p><ul><li><p>\"sort entries by shift, not just by day\": Are you suggesting <em>grouping</em> by shifts? If so, this is the existing behavior. However, it groups by day when there are no logbook filters. Since shifts are specific to each logbook (i.e., one logbook shifts may differ from another), we made the decision to just ignore grouping by shifts when there are no logbook filters and just use days. Although when one or more logbooks are selected, entries are grouped by shift. If you meant something else or if you did mean grouping and still have prefer different behavior, let me know.</p></li><li><p>\"alternate (white) entries between white and lightly shaded for easier following AND/OR...\": I'll take this into consideration and experiment with the design.</p></li><li><p>\"add color coding for different programs (in the current elog, it is light blue for LCLS (Cu), frosted orange for FACET, and light pink for LCLS-SC)\": Difficulty is that entries may belong to multiple logbooks and thus choosing one color is not possible. However, we understand the readability of entries needs to be worked on and will try to make it better.</p></li><li><p>\"I wish it was easier to follow chains of followed-up entries. I like how in the current elog, followup entries are highlighted green and whether entries are originals or followups is indicated with the F/f flags.\": We tried to resolve these issue by using icons to the left of the entries. Follow ups have a chat bubble icon on the left (which you should be able to see in this entry). Furthermore, we have three different icons for different configurations of references (see figure 1). However, there are still issues with this design and bugs to fix. We will take this into consideration and make it a priority, as this is a very important part of the ELog.</p></li><li><p>\"the image functionality should eventually be interoperable with the print queue system. Dragging and dropping files from the OPI is not practical. 90% or so of images in the elog come from an OPI application called Screen Grabber that prints to a print queue that the elog can access. Ask Matt Gibbs about this for more information.\": I'm pretty sure Claudio Bisegni is working on this right now (if not already almost completed). However, I let him know just in case.</p></li><li><p>\"images seem to render at an extremely large size. Maybe make the default size smaller?\" This is a problem and should be fixed.</p></li><li><p>\"have some way for a user to set a default logbook. For most of us, 99% of our entries will be in the mccelog, so I'd like that to be the default for me so I don't have to specify it every time.\" The core idea behind this elog design was to as much power as possible in the filter system. Since filters are saved in the URL, users can save specific configurations of filters by bookmarking the URL. This way users could have, for example, MCC bookmark with the MCC selected, and another bookmark with specific tags as well.</p></li></ul><p>I have a meeting, so I'll respond to the rest of the suggestions once its over. Thank you once again.</p><p></p>",
